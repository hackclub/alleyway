# Video logging tips!

_How the heck do I video log?? what do I need in them?? am I doing this right??_

WELL I am glad you asked!! Here's the rundown:

Video logs are how you document the story of your project. It's how you share your day-to-day journey with your projects. All of the highs and lows, ups and downs.

The best logs are the ones that feel like you're giving an update to a friend. It's OK to vulerable and have a messy room, weird background noises, etc. We are a community trying to build awesome things.

**You should be recording logs 1-3 times a day.** A good guideline is one every 3-4 hours, with each one ideally being 0.5 - 1 min. This isn't a hard requirement though

Here's some do's and dont's for logging:

---

**DO:**

-   Share what you did! I.e I added this part to the case today, I wrote the firmware, etc
-   Talk about any challenges & failures you had to overcome along the way!
-   Be yourself - we're all here to build awesome things, not judge each other

**Don't**

-   only share a 5-second clip of a feature working. Talk about what you did to get there! we're interested in more than just the final demo
-   turn this into a school assignment. We don't need a highly edited formal video in a monotone voice read off a script (you know exactly what I'm talking about)

---

### Some final words:

You don't need to show your face in these! This isn't some anti fraud verification - share stuff because you find it interesting, not because you need to prove every little thing you did

I'll try to have some examples up by the end of this week! Try your best guess at it in the meantime
