# Submitting your design!

Feeling like you're ready to submit? Just want to know what you need? Here's the place!

## Project checklist:

Ready to submit your project? Amazing!! Make sure you have all of the following to get your grant:

### Concept sheet

This should be the main sheet for your idea/design! Make it look awesome - it'll keep you motivated to work on it if you have something inspiring to look forwards to

-   Approximately what your project will look like (the more angles / sketches the better!!)
-   A list of its features
-   What parts youâ€™ll need on the page (links not necessary)

### GitHub Repository

This is where you'll upload your project files! Make sure it has the following:

-   a BOM in CSV format, with links to _exactly_ what you're going to buy
-   your sketch sheet with the filename CONCEPT.png in the root of the project folder
-   a README.md with your CONCEPT.png linked, as well as a short 2-5 sentence of what your project is!
-   a wiring diagram of your project! it doesn't have to be high quality, but it should be legible

## After submitting.

After submitting, head on over to your [dashboard](/dashboard) and check if the project has been added to your account - note that this may take a few minutes to update.

If it did, you should be good! If it didn't, make sure that you put in the correct slack ID - otherwise it won't load. If there's still issues, please ask in #alleyway!
