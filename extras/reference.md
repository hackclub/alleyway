# The reference list

I am really bad at coding. This will be my first time actually shipping a web app if it hits live. I'm gonna keep a list of all the docs I reference here to keep a history of my process.

-   https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#app.get - info on passing down params
-   https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/#middleware - astro node middleware info
-   https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/blob/main/packages/better-auth/src/api/routes/account.ts - endpoints lmfao

I HATE BETTER AUTH DOCS HAHAHAHAHAHA

## Notes:

-   the BaseURLs are only referenced in astro.config.mjs and auth.ts for frontend, no need to dig everywhere
