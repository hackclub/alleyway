## BTS thoughts:

Goals:

-   No more designs. It's not in the DB unless it's real.
-   Build stuff with personality.
-   Test flight a lot of things:
    -   Lots of social reinforcement & visual media
    -   Properly collecting build hours
    -   Carrot instead of stick

This is gonna be an intense thing to run but it'll be worth.

## Premise!

This fall, build the best halloween costume you can think of - a literal arc reactor, LEDs sowed into clothing, ~~hackable dog collars~~, and more!

Build gadgets & accessories you can wear and carry around. Get $50 from Hack Club for each. Video log the process. Repeat until the event ends October 24th.

Create at least 3 to get flown to Supercon, a hacker festival on the weekend of Halloween. (Oct 31 - Nov 1). Tickets & accommodation fully paid for by Hack Club! Flight stipends available

## How it works:

1. Sketch out a concept sheet for your project!
2. Create a BOM w/ links for where you're going to get the stuff
3. Put it on github! Submit it through the form here (NOT MADE YET WAIT UP)
4. Get $50 to make the project. Record video updates of your progress! Post it in \#wearable-gadget-ysws-log (NOT FUNCTIONING YET SO YOU'LL HAVE TO REUPLOAD LATER)
5. After building it, write a short blog post about your final build and thoughts looking back
6. Repeat!

## Project guidelines:

-   Must be something designed to be kept on you, worn, or carried around. Desk pieces don't really count
-   Must be something you can reasonably finish within 2-3 weeks - no multi month projects because of waiting for parts etc.
-   The projects have effort! Please be honest with yourself

## Requirements:

### ship requirements (to get the grant):

-   You have a concept art sheet w/ the following:
    -   Approximately what it'll look like
    -   Features
    -   Parts needed
-   You have a BOM with links in CSV format.
-   You have a schematic with all the parts connected
-   If you have a previous project from this event, it must be at least electrically & mechanically functional before getting another grant.

### to go to supercon:

-   at least 3 of your projects meet the following criteria:
    -   The projects have effort put into them
        -   i.e strapping 5 LEDs to your shirt does not count, but an entire outfit embedded with LEDs could count for one!
    -   They work & are finished
    -   They have adequate video logs
        -   30s - 2min, more guidelines be posted this weekend
    -   You can bring all of them to Supercon
